Hi, I am *@jackYin* (Yin, Tianyu), a master student of School of Microelectronics. You can find my moments and working on [Bilibili](http://space.bilibili.com/88834804), [Blog](https://yintianyu.github.io), [Weibo](https://weibo.com/2214514502), [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/yin-tian-yu-34), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ytyhero007/) and [Github](http://github.com/yintianyu).

I received my bacholar's degree at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn), and I'm pursuing my master's degree at SME of [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn).


This blog is to log the interesting and meaningful things I met when studying and working.

This blog doesn't support comments now given that no excellent comment platform available in Mainland China. If any one wants to contact with me please email me at eecsyty@outlook.com, I will reply very soon.
